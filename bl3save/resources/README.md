`inventoryserialdb.json.xz` is generated by the script `gen_inventory_db.py`
right in this directory.  It needs a vanilla `InventorySerialNumberDatabase.dat`
in the same directory to do its work.  (That can be found by unpacking the
BL3 pak files.  Note that this file practically always gets updated with
new patches.)

`balance_name_mapping.json.xz` is generated by the script
`gen_balance_name_mapping.py` which is found in the
[`dataprocessing` directory of my bl3mods area](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/blob/master/Apocalyptech/dataprocessing/gen_balance_name_mapping.py).
It relies on the CSVs used for my balance/part spreadsheets (generated by [`gen_item_balances.py`](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/blob/master/Apocalyptech/dataprocessing/gen_item_balances.py)), so we've got a
chain of data generation going on here.

`balance_to_inv_key.json.xz` is generated by the script
`gen_balance_to_invpart.py` which is found in the
[`dataprocessing` directory of my bl3mods area](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/blob/master/Apocalyptech/dataprocessing/gen_balance_to_invpart.py).
It relies on my [Borderlands 3 Object Refs](http://apocalyptech.com/games/bl3-refs/)
database to do its thing.
